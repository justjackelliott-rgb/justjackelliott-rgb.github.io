    <h1> US Troop Involvement in Germany from 1980-2000: An Explanation </h1>
    
    <p> The United States has the largest military force in the world. There is a US troop presence in almost every single country in the world, including countries considered allied with the US. Involvement in Germany, especially during the cold war, can be very telling. </p>

    <p> After taking a look at the total U.S. troop deployments to Germany from 1950 to the present, I chose to focus on the trends from 1980-2000. U.S. Troops in Germany experienced a sharp decline, specifically between 1989 and 1996. An average of around 250k troops dropped to just over 60k. The main reason for this is, of course, the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany. As Soviet-controlled East Germany reunified with independent West Germany, U.S. troops slowly withdrew from Germany. Additionally, in 1991, the Soviet Union fell. Cold War tensions that had been driving U.S. occupation and involvement in West Germany finally eased, leading to a withdrawal to a normal level of troops between allied countries.  </p>
